Project should be run using the included makefile.
For collaborators using MinGW and Windows, use this step for makefile support
  1. Open the Windows command line.
  2. Install the mingw32-make package using the command "mingw-get install mingw32-make".
  3. Check installation using "ming32-make --version"
  4. The executable should be in C://MinGW//bin and named ming32-make.exe
  5. Rename this file to "make" to enable "make" command support.
  6. Check support in the command line using "make --version"
  7. The project can now be compiled using the "make" command, running the makefile and compiling all cpp .files.
  
After compiling, use the command "main" to run the program.
